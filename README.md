## Why I Built This

Digital resumes are static snapshots; they rarely capture how I design systems, run infrastructure, or deliver iterative improvements. I wanted a living space that mirrors my workflow and gives collaborators a single link to explore everything.

This portfolio lets me:

- Present my professional journey through interactive, data-driven components
- Centralize experience, tools, and case studies in one navigable hub
- Support both mobile browsing and print-friendly exports
- Ship updates continuously via GitHub Actions and Cloudflare Pages

---

## Portfolio at a Glance

- **Component-first UI** – Modular React components (`Navbar`, `LayoutContent`, `Avatar`, `ProjectDetail`, `HorizontalCard`) separate presentation from data.
- **Data-driven content** – Experiences, projects, testimonials, and tools live in `src/data/*`, enabling rapid content refreshes without JSX edits.
- **Four visual themes** – Light, dark, sepia, and monochrome palettes driven by a custom `ThemeProvider` + CSS tokens.
- **Payload-ready backend** – Users/Media collections, MongoDB adapter, and auto-generated admin routes ship with the repo.
- **Motion storytelling** – Framer Motion animates hero sections, cards, and project detail pages.

## Frontend Architecture

- **Layout System** – `LayoutContent` orchestrates Avatar placement and responsive breakpoints, while `Navbar` renders animated navigation tabs from `NavigationData`.
- **Theming** – `ThemeProvider` + `ThemeToggler` switch between CSS theme files (`light.css`, `dark.css`, `sepia.css`, `monochrome.css`). Typography defaults to Outfit via Next Font.
- **Content Modules** – Pages read from TypeScript data sources (`HomeInfo`, `ExpInfo`, `ProjectsData`, `ProjectInfo`, `ToolCategories`) so copy changes never require component rewrites.
- **Project Narratives** – `ProjectDetail` handles hero media, Markdown sections, tech stacks, link groups, and CTA buttons for every `/projects/*` route.
- **Animations** – `motionVariants` + Framer Motion power staggered entrances, card hover states, and in-view transitions.

---

## Payload CMS & Data

- **Collections** – `Users` (auth-enabled) and `Media` (upload-enabled with alt text) live in `src/collections/*` and are wired through `payload.config.ts`.
- **Mongo Adapter** – `@payloadcms/db-mongodb` connects via `DATABASE_URL`; `.env` also requires a `PAYLOAD_SECRET`.
- **Admin & APIs** – Next.js routes under `src/app/(payload)` expose `/admin`, GraphQL (`/api/graphql`), and REST endpoints. The first local login bootstraps an admin user.
- **CLI Utilities** – `pnpm payload`, `pnpm generate:types`, and `pnpm generate:importmap` support migrations, types, and import maps.
- **Type Safety** – Generated `src/payload-types.ts` keeps components honest across data boundaries.

---

## Key Features

- **Responsive & accessible UI** – Mobile-first layout, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and contrast-aware color tokens.
- **Multi-theme experience** – Toggle between four curated palettes with persisted preferences.
- **Rich project storytelling** – Dedicated case-study pages for government collaborations, DevOps experiments, and personal apps.
- **Animation-first feel** – Framer Motion enhances perceived performance and engagement across sections.

---

## Case Studies & Project Pages

- **Portfolio v2 (CI/CD Playground)** – Live Next.js + Payload experience hosted on Cloudflare Pages with zero-downtime deployments.
- **MYDS** – Malaysia Government Design System contributions documented under `/projects/myds` (components, docs, Storybook, i18n).
- **AskMyGov** – Centralized Q&A platform (pre-launch) with Elasticsearch and multilingual UI (`/projects/askmygov`).
- **Directory.gov.my** – Government staff directory modernization (`/projects/directory`).
- **NumazuScraper** – Disaster-alert tool scraping JMA data, combining Puppeteer, Docker, and hybrid hosting (`/projects/numazuscraper`).
- **ToDoList** – MERN-based realtime task manager deployed on self-hosted infrastructure with Docker + PM2 (`/projects/todolist`).
- **Expense Tracker** – Insight-driven finance dashboard leveraging Next.js, MongoDB Atlas, and Recharts (`/projects/expensetracker`).
- **Terraform AWS** – IaC templates for EC2 provisioning (`/projects/terraformaws`).
- **Smart Home Server** – Proxmox home lab powering websites, backups, and IoT automation (`/projects/homeserver`).

Each page is powered by `ProjectInfo.tsx`, ensuring consistent storytelling, tech stack summaries, and outbound links.

---

## Testing & Quality

- `pnpm test:int` – Vitest integration suite configured via `vitest.config.mts` + `vitest.setup.ts` (jsdom + React Testing Library ready).
- `pnpm test:e2e` – Playwright tests (`playwright.config.ts`) for end-to-end coverage.
- `pnpm lint` – ESLint with `eslint-config-next` for consistent code style.
- `pnpm devsafe` – Cleans `.next` before starting dev server when caches misbehave.
- Recommended: `tsc --noEmit` after schema or type-heavy refactors to ensure generated Payload types stay in sync.

---

## Versioning & Releases

- **Git tags** track milestones: `v1` covers the legacy build, `v2` represents the Payload-powered redesign.
- Tags are managed directly in this repo and mirrored on GitHub (see [Releases](https://github.com/harrisazmi/OnlinePortfolioV2/tags)).
- Each tag ties into CI/CD deployments (Cloudflare Pages + self-hosted services) for reproducible releases.

### Changelog

| Version | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `4.0.0` | **Dual-repo architecture** — Decoupled the CMS from the frontend monorepo, giving each layer its own deployment pipeline, dependency lifecycle, and release cadence for cleaner long-term maintenance. |
| `3.0.0` | **CMS-powered content** — Integrated Payload CMS with MongoDB, unlocking a structured admin panel, REST and GraphQL APIs, and type-safe collections to manage portfolio data without touching source code. |
| `2.0.0` | **Visual overhaul** — Rebuilt the UI with a component-first architecture, four curated themes, Framer Motion animations, and a responsive layout system that scales gracefully across devices. |
| `1.0.0` | **Foundation** — Launched the first public portfolio as a static Next.js website, establishing the core pages, navigation structure, and initial project showcases. |

---

## Deployment & Hosting

- **Cloudflare Pages** – Primary production host; every push to main triggers a fresh build.
- **Vercel Previews** – Automatic preview deployments for pull requests.
- **Self-hosted lab** – Non-`cf` domains (e.g., `https://portfolio.harrisviewcodes.uk/`) run on my Proxmox cluster using Docker, Portainer, PM2, and Cloudflare Tunnel. Servers can be spun up on demand for reviewers.
- **Dockerfile** – Provided standalone build requires `next.config.mjs` to set `output: 'standalone'` before building.
- **Local setup** –
  1. `pnpm install`
  2. `.env` with `DATABASE_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1/digital-portfolio` (or remote URI) and `PAYLOAD_SECRET=...`
  3. `pnpm dev` → visit `http://localhost:3000/home` and `http://localhost:3000/admin`
